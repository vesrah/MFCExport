# MFC / MyFigureCollection Owned List Export Tool
I fully admit I am not a Python dev so don't roast me over conventions, this is just a quick and dirty MFC / MyFigureCollection tool to export your owned figure list to CSV format.
Usecase behind this was to get a spreadsheet of figured owned by my girlfriend for insurance reasons.  It may break at any time.
### Usage
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python mfcExport.py mfc-username`
